# NgHabitTracker

An angular project creating a habit tracker. 

The user will be able to add habits to their list and tick off when they do it on each day. Eventually, user will be able to see their progress on the 'history' tab.

This is a work in progress since 24/10/2019, after one week of learning about the Angular framework.

## Project aims:
To practice how to structure components and make them interact within Angular. 
To Practice using concepts like event emitters, attribute binding and string interpolation.

Once I learn about routing, I would like to use this to be able to navigate through the start page to different pages in my app.

## General Angular config:
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
